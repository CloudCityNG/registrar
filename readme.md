### By _**Jessica Fix and Joseph Karasek**_

## Description

_This web app is designed to collect and display university registrar information including students and courses. The goal is to practice use of mySQL and JOIN statements._

_The following user stories were provided..._

* As a registrar, I want to enter a student, so I can keep track of all students enrolled at this University. I should be able to provide a name and date of enrollment.
* As a registrar, I want to enter a course, so I can keep track of all of the courses the University offers. I should be able to provide a course name and a course number (ex. HIST100).
* As a registrar, I want to be able to assign students to a course, so that teachers know which students are in their course. A course can have many students and a student can take many courses at the same time.
